Hackathon Project Report: Enhancing Stock Portfolio Strategies

Introduction:

Our project focused on refining and enhancing algorithmic trading methods for stock portfolios. 
Leveraging QuantRocket for data retrieval, analysis, and strategy execution, our goal was to develop effective strategies that adapt to market dynamics

Data Preparation:

Extracts historical stock price data for a specific security (e.g., AAPL) from a database.
Processes and organizes the data into a pandas DataFrame.

Visualization:

Plots the daily returns over time.
Plots the closing prices over time.

State Calculation:

Calculates the state of the stock based on daily returns. States are categorized as 1 (positive return), 0 (neutral return), or -1 (negative return).

Portfolio Management:

Implements a simple portfolio management strategy based on state transitions. Buys are made when transitioning from a neutral state to a positive state, and sells are made when transitioning from a neutral state to a negative state.
Probability Distribution of Portfolio Values:

Calculates the probability distribution of portfolio values based on the implemented strategy.

Visualization of Results:

Visualizes the probability distribution of portfolio values using a bar plot.
Visualizes the distribution of states using a count plot.

Modeling:

Performs auto ARIMA model selection to determine the best parameters for forecasting stock prices.
Fits an ARIMA model to the historical stock price data.

Forecasting:

Generates forecasts for the next 20 days using the fitted ARIMA model.
Creates a DataFrame to display the forecasted values with dates.

Insight:
The code illustrates the application of QuantRocket for developing algorithmic trading strategies, 
focusing on optimizing stock portfolio performance through data analysis and forecasting techniques.

Conclusion:
By utilizing QuantRocket's capabilities, traders can enhance their decision-making process, 
adapt to market changes, and potentially improve investment outcomes. Continued refinement and testing of these strategies are essential for maximizing returns 
and managing risks effectively
